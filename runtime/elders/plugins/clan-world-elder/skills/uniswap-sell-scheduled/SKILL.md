# Uniswap sell scheduled

The default for sells when you DON'T need the gold this tick. Better execution than `sell-immediate` because the queue runs FIFO at heartbeat against pool state at that moment.

## When to use

- You hold inventory you want to convert to gold but no urgent buyer-side need.
- You're playing trader archetype (Verdant Wardens, sometimes Crimson) and stacking scheduled actions across ticks.
- You want to commit a price floor — combine with `MarketBuy` exact-output on a different pair to create a dependency chain.

## Order shape

Same `MarketSell` shape as immediate, but with a `scheduled: true` flag (or via the scheduled queue endpoint — check the `elder` MCP tool surface for the exact shape once stabilized).

## Mechanic

1. You queue at tick N.
2. Order sits in Unicorn Town pending queue.
3. At tick N+1 heartbeat, queue processes FIFO — your order executes against pool state at that moment.
4. If your worker is no longer Waiting + Unicorn Town at execution time, order fails silently (resource still in inventory).

## When NOT to use

- You need gold THIS tick — use `sell-immediate`.
- Queue is already long (deeper than ~5) — your execution latency may exceed your usefulness window.
- Your worker assignment will likely change before next heartbeat — order is wasted.

## Output to remember

Call `memory_save` with key `sell-scheduled:ore:tick-N` and value like:

```
queued 4e18 ore @scheduled tick-N+1, queue depth 3
```

*S2 placeholder skill. The exact shape for scheduled orders is TBD; currently call `submit_orders` with the orders array passed INLINE (containing the appropriate ClanOrder type) — never write a json file or use bash `cat`/heredoc.*
