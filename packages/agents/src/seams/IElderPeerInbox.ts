/**
 * IElderPeerInbox — private Elder-to-Elder diplomacy transport.

 * Contract:
 * - Messages are ordered (FIFO) within a sender/recipient pair per tick.
 * - Peer messages are agent-private: not mirrored to Convex or the UI in S2.
 * - send() writes to the RECIPIENT's inbox (indexed by recipient clan ID), not the sender's.
 * - inbox() reads the caller Elder's own inbox (indexed by the Elder's own clan ID).
 * - Implementations must be idempotent: the runner may re-deliver a whisper on retry;
 *   implementations that guarantee exactly-once must deduplicate by (fromClanId, tick, msgId).
